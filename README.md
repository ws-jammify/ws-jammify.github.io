## About The Project

Jammify is a modern music player interface that demonstrates the implementation of front-end web technologies. This project showcases the use of React components, state management, and modern web APIs to create an interactive music player experience.

**Note:** This is a front-end demonstration project. All data is stored locally in JSON files, and there is no backend server or database integration.
